The Odin Project Etch a Sketch

This project is a very simple Etch-a-Sketch game made using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
It can be accessed and played with here: https://lukiakos.github.io/top-etch-a-sketch/
I followed the instructions of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

I styled the site to look like Windows 95. 
For this, I referenced AlexBSoft's win95.css (https://github.com/AlexBSoft/win95.css) and used some of his lines of code.

Some functionalities:
- choose grid size with a slider
- choose brush colour (normal mode)
- randomized brush colour for every tile (rainbow mode)
- download the image you've drawn (using html12canvas)
- clear board
- icon on the desktop as well as an X button (like in Win95)

Overall a very fun project to do.
Feel free to use any part of it for your own projects, I just kindly ask you to mention me in your readme.
